Our easy-to-use 3D viewing and drawing tool is built to assist in the digitization and automation of our technology center's infrastructure. Designed with both technical and non-technical users in mind, this tool empowers teams to visualize, design, and manage their infrastructure with precision and clarity. By bringing your physical environment into a 3D digital space, it simplifies complex processes and enhances efficiency across your operations.
Key Features:
- Intuitive 3D Visualization:
Navigate through the entire infrastructure with a 360 degrees view. 
The 3D environment allows users to explore layouts, equipment placements with real measurements, and infrastructure components with a close to real figures in a way thatâ€™s engaging and visually clear, making it easier for all team members to comprehend the space, even those without technical expertise.
- Effortless Drawing and Design Tools:
Whether we're adding new infrastructure elements or redesigning existing ones, the drawing features allow for easy modifications directly within the user interfaces. 
We can place any infrasture components with ease and precision. 
These tools are engineered to minimize manual errors, making design faster and more accurate with real measurements.
- Customizable Infrastructure Components: 
we can bring any physical infrastructure to life with customizable models that reflect our actual technology setup. From racks and tiles to more intricate equipment, users can adjust dimensions, colors, and placement to ensure that the digital model mirrors the real-world infrastructure.
and developers can easily introduce new components any time we need.
- Full Offline Capabilities:
The tool allows you to design and visualize any time without needing the internet.
